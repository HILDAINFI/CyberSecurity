* Hashcat-open source password cracking tool.
* John the Ripper- advanced offline password cracker, which supports hundreds of hash and cipher types, and runs on many operating systems, CPUs, GPUs, and even some FPGAs.
* Hydra(THC-Hydra)- It is fast,flexible and easy it is to gain.
The above tools are used a common terminology called as Brute Force.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Brute Force:A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys. 
            It is a simple yet reliable tactic for gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts and organizationsâ€™ systems and networks. 
            The hacker tries multiple usernames and passwords, often using a computer to test a wide range of combinations, until they find the correct login information.
* vulnerability : weakness for networks.
* RAT: A RAT (remote access Trojan) is malware an attacker uses to gain full administrative privileges and remote control of a target computer.
* Attacks: =>using someone's system/software without their permission.
           =>both hardware/software attacks.
* Port Scanning
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Security & safe guarding the system using CIA Traids
=> physical control
=> administrative control
=> logical control
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cyber Security: securing the source/data.
* Networking :A medium to connection.
* TCP/UDP : => Protocols(set of rules).
            => communicate with hardware and software
            => TCP has 65535 ports(entry gate) and UDP has 65535 ports.
* https : port 443 will run with lock symbol which is safe and secure.
* http : port 80 with unsafe and secured platform.
* HTTP/HTTPs - diff b/w
* Block chain security.
* Exlpoit
* SQL injection
* Session Hijacking - without password and username we can access the account.
* Internet Phising
* DNS Poising
* IP Address
* Cloud 
* Cryptography
* APR poising
* Spoofing
* Hashing
* Meta sploit
* Back door
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Hacking - gaining unauthorized access.
* Ethical Hacking - with return concerns/permission.
* Web Application penetration Testing.
* Web Application VS Website VS Web Server VS Webpage.
* Web Application - user interactions are more.
* Website - collection of webpages.
* Webpages - shows content,images,text etc....
* Webserver - Browsing system or computer by the user.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Two career opportunities / types :
     => offensive (red team) - ethical hacking,Attack.
     => defensive (blue team) - SOC(Security Operational Center)Analytics,Reverse enginnering,Malware experts
     => (purple team) - mixer of both red and blue team
* types of hackers:
     => White hat - complete architecture/technology given to the attackers.
     => Black hat - 0% knowledge about the architecture.
     => Grey hat - both the white and black hats(mrgn legal and night illegal)
* Script Kiddies
* Hactivism - socialized hackers
* State Sponsored Hackers - Government hacks another Government details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* CIA Traid (Network Security) :                                                                                           =====important question=====
      C - Confidentiality
      I - Integrity
      A - Avaliability
* Autentication : verifying the details of the user
                => something you know(password,email,Two step Verfication,secret things etc...)
                => something you have(OTP,Aadhar,Voter ID,Pan card,License etc.....)
                => something about you(Biometrics,behaviour patterns etc....)
 ====[If you use two factors from the above list that is "2-step verification", If you use all the 3 factors then it is "Multi-step Authentication"]====
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Authorization/Access Control(AC) : permission given to use some datas or files etc.....      
* Confidentiality : 
                => UAC(User Access Control) popup.
* Integrity : Originality/Genuinity/Honest
                => It is mostly used in https-443 port.They secure SSL certificate.
                => Whenever you create website or application you have to use integrity to avoid script kiddies or malcious attackers.
* Encryption : conversion of clear text to siffer text(human not understandable form).
* Availability : best example 
                => ATM Machine in the time of Demodilization.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Breach - The loss of control,comprises,unauthorized disclosure,unauthorized acquisition or any similar occurence where :
            a person other than an authorized user access or potentially access personally identificable 
* Event - Any observable occurence in a network or system.NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2.
* Exploit - A particular attack.It is named this way because these attacks exploit system vulnerabilities.
* Incident - An event that actually or potentially jeoparadizes the confidentiality,integrity and availability of an information system or the information the system.
             A thing which affect CIA is called "Incident".
* Intrusion - Security alert/event,or combination of events.
* Threat - Any circumstances or event with the potential to damage a system or organizational operations.
* vulnerability - Weakness in an information system.
=======[If a threat with vulnerability it is called Risk]========
* TOE - Target Of Evaluation
* MySQL - 3306 port.
* IPv4 - 32bits
example : 192.168.1.1./24  - TOE { 0-9 } => Decimal to Binary
conversion 10000000.10101000.00000001.00000001/24   => don't use 1st 24 bits use remaining bits
* There are 256 possible IP Address : 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255  => 256 IPs
