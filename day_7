Reading arbitary files via path traversal:
  => never use root user
etc/passwrd - can enumurate the username.
cyber chef - website to encode and decode the txt,images etc....
  => images can convert into base64 and we can decode that image.
terminal name - bin/bash running in bash shell
bin/bash - shows the user of that application or images.
         - remaining all are application interface.
....//....//....//....// - if someone block the ..// then we use this type of format for images.

* path traversal = file inclusion  => another name
* we can run two or more commands at a time => cat /etc/passwd | grep /bin/bash
| - pipe => left side command will send as inout to right side command using pipe.
         => it is dependently will work becoz left side command will not come to right side only right get work and show the output.
 eg : cat /etc/passwd | grep TeamA    
grep - 
&& => can combine 2 or more commands
   => It is independently will work.
 eg : mkdir MKCE && cd MKCE && touch test.
 eg : 192.168.0.1 && ver
DVWA - Damn Vulnerable Web Application
   => You can get a kali virtually.
* Shell types : 
   => Web portal - browser
   => Bind shell - process/service/port combine
   => Reverse shell - user interaction
REVERSE SHELL :
* revshells.com - using this website we can access any one system by sending only one line
nc -lvnp  => net cat listen ver net port 8888
* tcpview and process utilities => check whether our system is hacked or not.
WEB SHELL : 
* chaining vulnerability
