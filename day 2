* If you use it for 1000 times then the system will hang so the person should restart or reboot the system.
* Executable format in windows: .exe , .bat
* Environmental variable : to set the path.
* CIDR's opposite is Subnet mask.
* ping 172.1.44.44 -c 4
  here c - "count" requires administrative previlege ; 4 - no.of.packets has to be return in linux. While using ----------kali----------
  -c is a switch / flag.
* In Windows : use --help 
  here they many commands or options called switch or flag.
  example : to ping 
            ping google.com -n 10
  here -n => no.of.counts and 10 is no.of.packets 
  we use this in windows.
* windows -n
* linux -c
* to connect with same devices use "cross-over" wire is used.
* to connect with different devices use "straight-through" wire is used.
* RJ45 - ethernet color cable.
* fibre optics and coaxial wires. 
* to connect to routers use "serial cables".
* Full Duplex VS Half Duplex.
   => Full Duplex - 2 way communication.
   => Half Duplex - 1 way communication.
* NIC - Network Interface Card.
* MAC address - Permanent Network address.
* Hub is a repeater or an extention or use to coonect 
* vulnerability in Hub : Data transfer to all the connected PC's.
* PING uses ICMP Protocol : if you block ICMP protocol only ping will not work, by blocking TCP/UDP will not affect ping control
