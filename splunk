Open academy in vmware
username: root
pass : tcm

ip link set dev ens33 up

dhclient -v ens33

now you can see the ip address for the academy

GO to windows
cmd :
- ssh root@ipaddress
- useradd -m splunkfwd
- groupadd splunkfwd
- export SPLUNK_HOME="/opt/splunkforwarder"
- mkdir $SPLUNK_HOME

then download splunk download for linux and copy that link

paste in the terminal

then use dpkg -i filename to install

- chown -R splunkfwd:splunkfwd $SPLUNK_HOME
- $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk start --accept-license
set administrator user name and pass

then navigate to opt/splunkforward/bin

then check status
- ./splunk status
Check it is runnning

./splunk add forward-server 172.1.42.44:9997

then put username pass created in cmd

then goto splunk webpage
localhost:8000 

setting -> forwarding and receiving -> configure recieving -> add port 9997

then 
setting -> monitor console -> forwarders -> forwarder instance -> enable the setup

then you can see the academy

to check - ./splunk list forward-server

similarly remove - ./splunk remove forward-server

ssh - it is a server which gives remotly access a machine.
    - encrypted message can be send.
port number - 9997 => splunk forwarder will send data and this port number will receive.
splunk forwarder - it is use to send the log data from academy linux to windows machine. So,we use a seperate ports.
                 Eg : Authentication log etc...
                 - this logs are saved in var/log => variable directory/shell.
